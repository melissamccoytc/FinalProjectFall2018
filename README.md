# FinalProjectFall2018
Final project for Object Oriented Programming I, created by Zhe S. and myself.

This project runs a quiz program that allows you to choose from three Harry Potter characters - Harry, Ron, or Hermione.
You then answer a series of true/false questions about this character.
Finally, you receive your score, and are given the opportunity to try again with one of the characters.
